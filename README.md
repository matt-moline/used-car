# Business Understanding
The business objectives for this project are:
- evaluate the provided used car dataset
- analyze to gain insights
- explore Data and creating a Data Exploration Report
- identify the features that have the highest correlation with the price of the car

We are being asked to perform this exercise so that the business can identify impactful characteristics to maximize revenue and apply costs where most likely to deliver profit.

# Data Understanding
Three tasks were performed initially to facilitate understanding of the data. These are:
- Load the data and gather information on any missing values that would need to be imputed</li>

There are 426,880 entries in the database.  The following data elements are catalogued in the dataset.  After each element I share to total number of records with data of this type:

id - 426,880 records with this data
region - 426,880
price - 426,880 
year - 425,675
manufacturer - 409,234 
model - 421,603
condition - 252,775
cylinders - 249,202 
fuel - 423,867 
odometer - 422,480
title_status - 418,638 
transmission - 424,324 
VIN - 265,838 
drive - 296,313 
size - 120,518 
type - 334,022 
paint_color - 296,677 
state - 426,880 

	
# Model and Findings
After having completed the analysis of used car sales, these machine-learning models have predicted that the price of a vehicle can be determined with 31% accuracy. The key factors in driving price to maximize revenue are Size and Drive

Additional work would need to be completed to improve the accuracy of this model and to identify additional driving factors
